# Official Go Library for [Pepipost](http://www.pepipost.com/?utm_campaign=GitHubSDK&utm_medium=GithubSDK&utm_source=GithubSDK)

This library contains methods for easily interacting with the Pepipost Email Sending API to send emails within few seconds.

We are trying to make our libraries Community Driven- which means we need your help in building the right things in proper order we would request you to help us by sharing comments, creating new [issues](https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-sdk-go/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-sdk-go/pulls).

We welcome any sort of contribution to this library.

The latest 5.0.0 version of this library provides is fully compatible with the latest Pepipost v5.0 API.

For any update of this library check [Releases](https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-sdk-go/releases).

* Change your directory to **$GOPATH** 
  
  ``` cd $GOPATH```

* make project using below command 

  ```  mkdir $GOPATH/src/pepipost_test && cd $GOPATH/src/ ```
  
  ![pic7](http://app1.falconide.com/integration_imgs/goimg/capture(28).png)

* Clone or download the repository using below command

  ``` git clone https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-sdk-go.git ```
  
  **OR**
  
  Download **[zip](https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-sdk-go/archive/master.zip)**


* Create sample Go file named **main.go** in 

``` cd $GOPATH/src/pepipost_test ```

  copy the below [sample example](#example) in your ```main.go``` file.
  
* Change your api-key and sending domain respectively

    * **apikey** will be available under Login to Pepipost -> Settings -> Integration  
    * **Sending Domain** will be available under Login to Pepiost -> Settings -> Sending Domains 
  
    ```
  *Note :: Domains showing with Active status on Sending Domain dashboard are only allowed to send any sort of emails.* In case there are no Sending Domain added under your account, then first add the domain, get the DNS (SPF/DKIM) settings done and get it reviewed by our compliance team for approval. Once the domain is approved, it will be in ACTIVE status and will be ready to send any sort of emails. 
    ```
* Sending first email using Go library

  ```go build main.go```
  
  ```./main.exe ``` (for windows) **OR** ```./main```
